# ModLab 🖥️💡

🚧 **Project in progress** – This project is still under development. We are actively working on adding features and improving the user experience. Some parts may not be fully implemented yet.

## Description

**ModLab** is an online store for buying computers and computer components. The goal is to offer users a clean and intuitive platform to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and make purchases securely.

Users must register and log in to access certain pages and complete purchases. If you are not logged in, you won't be able to access private pages or buy anything. This ensures that only registered users can place orders.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Maven**
- **JDK**
- **MySQL**
- **Angular**
- **TypeScript**
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

## Features

- 🧾 User registration and login
- 🔐 Access control: non-logged-in users cannot access certain pages
- 🛍️ View list of products (computers and components)
- 🛒 Add products to a shopping cart
- 💳 Buy products from the cart (only if logged in)

## How It Works

1. The user registers an account and logs in.
2. Once logged in, the user can view available products.
3. Products can be added to a shopping cart.
4. The user can go to the cart and proceed to checkout to place an order.
5. If the user is not logged in, they will be redirected and won't be able to make a purchase.
